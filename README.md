Easily manage devices and device tokens for your users.



## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require sfolador/devices
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="devices-config"
```
This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
     'allow_device_reassign' => false,
];
```

if you set `allow_device_reassign` to true, it will be possible to 
register a device for a user and then assign it to another user. This happens usually 
in mobile applications with multi-accounts on the same device.


You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="devices-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

the migration will create the `Devices` table and its columns will be:

- `id` - the device id
- `notifiable_id` - the "user" id
- `notifiable_type` - the "user" type
- `name` - the device name
- `type` - the device type (mobile, web)
- `platform` - the device platform (ios, android, web)
- `token` - the device token
- `created_at` - the device creation date
- `updated_at` - the device update date

## Usage

It's possible to use the `HasDevices` trait in your `User` model:

```php
use Sfolador\Devices\Models\Concerns\HasDevices;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasDevices;
}
```

At this point is possible to retrieve the devices of a user:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->devices;
```

To register a new `Device`, for example from a mobile app, you can use the provided route `POST /api/devices/attach`:

```php
Route::post('/devices/attach', [DeviceController::class, 'attach']);
```

### Device parameters



The register a Device you need a request with these parameters:

```php

$rules = [
    'platform' => ['required', new Enum(DevicePlatform::class)],
    'type' => ['required', new Enum(DeviceType::class)],
    'token' => 'required|string',
];

```

DevicePlatform is an Enum that can have these values: android, ios, web.
DeviceType is an Enum that can have these values: mobile, web
